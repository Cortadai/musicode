# Project

## What This Is

**Musicode** — a personal web-based music player for local audio files (FLAC, MP3, OGG, M4A). Spring Boot 3 backend scans configured folders, reads metadata with JAudioTagger, streams audio with HTTP Range support. React + Vite + TypeScript frontend provides a modern, dark-themed UI for browsing and playing a personal library. Runs in Docker Compose with embedded H2 database — zero external dependencies.

Think "my own VLC but prettier, in a browser, and personal."

## Core Value

**Play my local FLAC/MP3 files from a browser with proper seeking, metadata display, and cover art.** If scope shrinks, this survives: scan a folder, browse tracks/albums/artists, click play, hear audio with seek support.

## Current State

Fully functional music player with 13 milestones complete. Library of 877 tracks scanned. Multi-user auth, listening stats, scrobbling integrations, real-time activity feed, Swagger API docs, gapless playback, crossfade, 5-band parametric EQ, expandable visualizer (3 modes), fullscreen Now Playing overlay with cover art color extraction and inline visualizer selector, code-split routes with role-based guards, GitHub Actions CI, and 345 tests (236 backend + 109 frontend).

## Architecture / Key Patterns

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 | SPA, dark theme (zinc + indigo), TanStack Query |
| Backend | Spring Boot 3.4 + Java 21 + Maven | REST API, async scanning, SSE |
| Database | H2 (file mode, embedded) | Zero config, metadata + plays + users |
| Metadata | JAudioTagger 2.2.5 | ID3/Vorbis/MP4 tag reading (incl. ALBUM_ARTIST) |
| Audio | Web Audio API graph (dual HTMLAudioElement) | Gapless playback, extensible node chain |
| Auth | Spring Security + JWT in HttpOnly cookies | Access 15min, refresh 7 days, rotation |
| API Docs | SpringDoc OpenAPI 2.8.14 | Swagger UI at /swagger-ui.html |
| Charts | Recharts | Stats dashboard |
| E2E Testing | Playwright (Chromium) | 21 E2E tests |
| Icons | Lucide React | |
| Containers | Docker Compose + Caddy | HTTPS, reverse proxy |

**Monorepo layout:**
- `musicode-server/` — Spring Boot backend
- `musicode-ui/` — React frontend

**Key technical patterns:**
- HTTP 206 Partial Content for audio seeking (RandomAccessFile + Range headers)
- Async library scanning (`@Async` + `@EnableAsync`)
- ALBUM_ARTIST tag for album grouping (prevents compilation fragmentation)
- Cover art extracted during scan, cached as `{albumId}.jpg` on disk
- `PlayerContext` with `useReducer` + dual contexts (state/dispatch separation)
- Centralized `audioGraph.ts` — owns the full Web Audio API pipeline (gain → analyser → destination)
- Dual HTMLAudioElement for gapless playback — pre-loads next track ~3s before end, swaps seamlessly
- Audio preferences (volume, shuffle, repeat) persisted in localStorage
- Playback tracking at 50% duration threshold → stats + scrobble + activity feed
- SSE (SseEmitter) for real-time activity feed
- Async scrobbling with exponential backoff (fire-and-forget from PlayController)
- Cookie auth with refresh queue (axios interceptor handles concurrent 401s)
- Media Session API for OS integration (media keys, now-playing, seek bar)
- PWA with hand-written service worker (network-first shell, cache-first covers)

**Entities:**
- `Track` → `Album` → `Artist` (library)
- `User` → `Role` (ADMIN/LISTENER)
- `RefreshToken` (auth)
- `PlaybackEvent` (stats/scrobbling)
- `LibraryFolder` (scan config)

- [ ] M015: Integrations & Streaming — Synchronized lyrics (.lrc), transcoding, Subsonic API, Bandcamp import

## Pending Setup

- Last.fm API key + secret need to be configured via env vars (`LASTFM_API_KEY`, `LASTFM_API_SECRET`) for scrobbling to work. Create an app at https://www.last.fm/api/account/create.
